Have been a programmer for almost 25 year means you have heard a lot of stories, embrace several languages and sharp your brain to respond all situations.

Does that mean you should move out of the world, sure of your knowledge ?

Ok … Time to forget everything, meet the youngest and the brave.

**Time to join the startuper’s world !**
